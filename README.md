# Hi, I’m @FdezCarlomagno 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate developer with a keen interest in building innovative web applications and web services. I love working on both the frontend and backend, and I am always eager to learn and grow in the ever-evolving tech world.

## 👀 About Me

I am primarily focused on **web development** and creating efficient, user-friendly **web services**. With a strong foundation in **UX/UI design**, I aim to create not only functional but also aesthetically pleasing applications. I strive to design user interfaces that are intuitive and engaging, while also ensuring smooth user experiences across platforms.

I'm currently exploring a variety of technologies to expand my skillset, including:
- **Frontend**: React.js, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and modern JS frameworks.
- **Backend**: PHP, Java, and working with APIs to enable seamless data exchange between systems.
- **Databases**: Familiar with relational databases like MySQL and designing effective database structures.
- **Web Services**: Exploring RESTful APIs and integrating third-party services.

## 🌱 What I’m Currently Learning

I'm constantly pushing myself to learn new technologies and tools that can help me build better and more efficient applications. Here's what I'm currently focused on:
- **React.js**: I'm deepening my understanding of React to create dynamic, interactive user interfaces.
- **PHP & Java**: I've worked with both languages for backend development, handling everything from authentication to database queries.
- **JavaScript**: I'm sharpening my skills in vanilla JavaScript, as well as in modern frameworks and libraries.
- **Relational Databases**: I’ve been learning to design and manage relational databases, understanding how to build scalable and efficient database schemas.

I’m also diving into **system architecture**, focusing on how to design scalable web applications, APIs, and implement best practices in development and testing.

## 💞️ What I'm Looking to Collaborate On

I'm open to collaborating on projects where I can apply my knowledge of web development technologies. I'm particularly interested in:
- **Building full-stack applications**: Using a combination of frontend and backend technologies to create functional, full-featured apps.
- **API development**: Designing and building RESTful APIs to connect services and manage data.
- **Frontend development**: Crafting responsive, interactive UIs with React.js and other modern tools.
- **Database management**: Handling data and ensuring the integrity of relational databases.

If you have a project that involves any of these technologies or require an extra hand on a development task, feel free to reach out. I'm excited to contribute and learn from collaboration!
